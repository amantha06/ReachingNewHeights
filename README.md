# ReachingNewHeights
Reaching New Heights is an intricate machine learning prediction model to closely estimate the height you will reach in your life by using a number of factors.

# Process
To run this program, make sure all files are in the same directory and compile all files. 
First run app.py, either in python or command prompt, in order to begin the API.
Next run HackTJ.java and you should see a GUI pop up.
Interact with the GUI, it will keep on running until the API or program is terminated.

# Imports
You may need to import a few different python packages in order for this to work
Required Packages:
  Flask,
  numpy,
  pandas,
  scikit,
  joblib,
  traceback,
  matplotlib,

# Sources
For help with creating the Flask API, we used the following links: https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/machine-learning-models-api-python, https://chillyfacts.com/java-send-http-getpost-request-and-read-json-response/

To get our data of heights, we used Galton's data from this link https://www.randomservices.org/random/data/Galton.html
